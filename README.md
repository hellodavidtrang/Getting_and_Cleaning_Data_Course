Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
========================================================

The goal of this assignment is to demostrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set by the following requirement.

1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5.  Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each     activity and each subject. 

* Data for this assignment came from [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/).

* Data set: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
